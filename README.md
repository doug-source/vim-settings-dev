VIM Settings dev
================

This VIM setting was developed to used as the optional and default development editor. It has some plugins installed and also has a differentiated way to set the environment through a json file.

Initially it was designed and coded inside a Linux-like system but its execution into a Windows-like system is under construction (yet not tested).

Documentation is also being created gradually.
